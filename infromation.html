A hamburger, or simply burger, is a sandwich consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat,<br> typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese,<br> lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise,<br> relish, or a "special sauce," often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed <br> on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.[1]

<h6>fries</h6>
French fries (North American English), chips (British English and other national varieties),[1] finger chips (Indian English),<br>[2] french-fried potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut[3] deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium <br> or France. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, <br> blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are small <br> convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes.

Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: <br> [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat <br> base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese,<br> and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage , <br> anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham,<br> etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally <br> in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a <br>  pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
In Italy,<br> pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the <br> use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into <br> wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.
