   <h1>about samsung</h1>
<h2>history</h2>
Embracing new challenges to sustaining our legacy
After posting record sales and operating profits the previous year, Samsung Electronics set its sights on a new challenge as it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2019. Since then, Samsung has continually strived to become No. 1 in the system semiconductor industry while simultaneously driving growth in areas such as AI and 5G.
The company has continued to innovate to remain a world leader in memory semiconductors, TVs, and smartphones
In 2019, Samsung also declared its new CSR vision: “Together for Tomorrow! Enabling People.” The strategy outlined the company’s commitments as a global corporate citizen, articulating how Samsung strives to fulfill its social responsibilities and the ethos the company will adopt for the next century and beyond.

<h3>reasons why samsung is successful</h3>
Samsung has succeeded where SONY has failed. the biggest reason Samsung found more success compared to most other consumer electronics and smartphone brands is its focus on consumer oriented innovation.
The company makes a heavy investment in research and development every year and does not let its focus on innovation fall. Its ability to understand customer needs and preferences has also given it an edge.
Samsung does not just make get products like Galaxy smartphones or appliances like Televisions, but instead it offers great consumer experiences.
It has grown into a highly respected brand globally with a large consumer base. Good quality products, marketing and customer focus are the main factors apart from innovation driving its success. At least for SONY, there are one or two things it needs to learn from Samsung.
Samsung is more innovative and flexible and its wide product portfolio has several great products. Strategy is also a key factor that enabled higher success for Samsung. Its global business strategy and product strategies are far better than most competitors. While Apple is the leader in terms of innovation, Samsung has proved itself a fast paced organization in terms of innovation, culture and product ideas.
There are some other factors too that have made Samsung successful including its resilient business model, supply chain management and focus on brand image. Samsung’s business model is highly resilient. It has also managed its supply chain very well which is key to manufacturing great products. Apart from that, its brand image in almost all corners of the world is quite strong which is crucial to winning in the international market.
Samsung has overcome several flaws that other brands including SONY could not. It did not remain stuck in a rut or rely on limited products to find success globally. It has moved fast with time and fast paced innovation helped it penetrate global markets deeper. Samsung’s global growth and success are now well known. However, in a highly competitive market environment, its focus on research and development is a critical factor that has helped it maintain its edge and avoid loss of market share.
In a hypercompetitive and fast changing market environment, having a futuristic business strategy and not relying too much on past successes is important for growth and long term success. It is an area in which Samsung offers a lesson for other smartphone and consumer electronics brands

<h4>Samsung’s biggist rival</h4>
Apple’s Iphone is without doubt the number 1 Samsung competitor when we talk about high end smartphones. Almost every year, there are 3 smartphones sure to be launched. One would be an Iphone, another a Samsung Note and the third Samsung galaxy or Samsung galaxy edge. Iphone was one of the first phones to come out in the market with multi touch features.
However, although Iphone is loved by many, Samsung utilised Google Android to launched several features of its own, including some awesome hardware. The Apple vs Samsung (Android) debate is endless. Apple Iphone has the lions share of Smartphones in US and it is second highest market share holder worldwide and is one of the strongest Samsung competitors in the business.<br>
