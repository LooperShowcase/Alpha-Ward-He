      Samsung Group, or simply Samsung (Korean: 삼성; RR: samseong [samsʌŋ])
      (stylized as SΛMSUNG), is a South Korean multinational manufacturing
      conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul, South Korea. It
      comprises numerous affiliated businesses, most of them united under the
      Samsung brand, and is the largest South Korean chaebol (business
      conglomerate). As of 2020, Samsung has the eighth highest global brand
      value. Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading
      company. Over the next three decades, the group diversified into areas
      including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail.
      Samsung entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the
      construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas
      would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung
      was separated into five business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group,
      CJ Group and Hansol Group, and JoongAng Group. Notable Samsung industrial
      affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information
      technology company, consumer electronics maker and chipmaker measured by
      2017 revenues), Samsung Heavy Industries (the world's second largest
      shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues), and Samsung Engineering and
      Samsung C&T Corporation (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest
      construction companies). Other notable subsidiaries include Samsung
      Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest life insurance company),
      Samsung Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in
      South Korea) and Cheil Worldwide (the world's 15th largest advertising
      agency, as measured by 2012 revenues).
